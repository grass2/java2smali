Source code:
    https://github.com/izgzhen/java2smali

Run:
    edit Example.java
    run convert.sh

Compile:

    ./gradlew build

or, download: https://github.com/izgzhen/java2smali/releases

Run (in Unix system):

    ./java2smali example/Example.java

Then you should be able to find `*.smali` files in the `example/` directory.

Another example run with imports:

    APP_CLASSPATH=. ./java2smali example2/Example2.java

Note that `Example2.java` import `example.Example`, so you must specify its class path directory.

The following steps might work as well, as long as the `*.java` file
does not have a package namespace.

javac HelloWorld.java
dx --dex --output=classes.dex HelloWorld.class
baksmali classes.dex
